Former cavalry scout turned military data scientist and ML engineer.
Educated at USMA (Applied Mathematics, Military History) and Carnegie Mellon’s [MISM-BIDA](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/bida).

I focus on probabilistic modeling, analytics, and decision-support systems that remain useful when data is messy and stakes are high. Most of my work lives at the intersection of uncertainty, logistics, and real operational constraints.

### 📌 Highlighted Work
- **HES_Reevaluated** — Geospatial analysis of historical Vietnam-era military data, integrating messy archival sources with ArcGIS visualizations  
- **NETCOM_Capstone_S22** — Anomaly-detection web app using dynamic ensembles and SHAP, supporting real-world cybersecurity operations
