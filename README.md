> Tools, demos, projects

I'm a military Data Scientist and ML Engineer. Education include CMU's (MISM_BIDA)[https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/bida] and USMA undergrad (Math and Mil History). My focus is on probabilistic modeling, operational analytics, and decision support systems that remain useful when data is messy and stakes are high. I have deep experience with probabilistic modelling and logistics problem sets. Currently focusing on expanding my skillset with contemporary LLM stacks and building personal knowledge management tools to push myself further.

### 📌 Highlighted Work
- **HES_Reevaluated** — Geo-spatial analytics for historical military data from the Vietnam War, combining tidy R data processing for messy raw data from National Archives and arcGIS visualizations 
- **NETCOM_Capstone_S22** — Anomaly Detection Web App using dynamic ensembles and SHAP explanations, supporting NETCOM DSD PITT in detecting malicious cyber security traffic

### 🛠 Tech & Themes
**Languages:** Python, R, TypeScript &middot; **Focus areas:** probabilistic ML, operational analytics &middot; **Tools:** Flask/FastAPI, SHAP, Docker, AWS

I build systems that matter where data is imperfect and decisions are inevitable.
